Code book for getting and cleaning data course project.

The Raw data is provided on the coursera website and consists of the following files

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

Codebook:

--The final data set is 180 observations of 68 variables.
--the observations represent the average value of each variable for 30 individuals across 6 activities
--the first variable subject is a numerical subject identifier
--the second variable activity is the activity performed by the subject
--the remaining 66 variables are the measurements recorded by the device as described by the features_info.txt document, subsetted to only contain the mean and std dev variables

example: one observation row gives the mean recorded measurement for that particular feature for a subject-activity pair.
